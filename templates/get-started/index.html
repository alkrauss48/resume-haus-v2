        <p>Paper resumes dominate the job searching market, but you can't
        do much with them. No hiring manager will ever see your Microsoft Word
        resume and think "Wow, this is really well designed." And you
        might think, that's not the point of your resume - the point is
        the content and not how it looks. But really, think about it. If
        something is well built, we tend to spend more time with it and
        admire the actual content much more than something that is just
        thrown together. Still, you're pretty limited with an 8.5 x 11
        inch sheet of paper. That's where we come in. </p>
        <p><b>Resume Haus</b> specializes in building and hosting high quality resumes that leverage
        the true power of the web to show off who you really are. We
        account for all different types of data you may want to
        show off, like blocks of text, education, work experience, skills,
        awards, interests, and literally anything you can think of. If
        it's on your current resume - we'll make it look beautiful on your
        Resume Haus resume.</p>
